# Tiffany Kearns' Portfolio

Hello! I am Tiffany Kearns, a computer science major at CSUF.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
*Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it was exciting to learn the foundations of coding. I was able to successfully code my first working program using a coding language that was unfamiliar to me. I learned how to confidently use std::cout to print out messages onto the terminal, and then commit and push my work.

*Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was interesting to see how code can be utilized with math to quickly solve real-world problems. I was able to take the input of a certain amount of volume and convert it into varying measurements. I learned how to apply arithmetics such as division into my coding projects.

*Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because it was fascinating to create and play my own game of Blackjack. I was able to use command line arguments and boolean statements to predict a variety of possible game outcomes. I learned how a card game can be translated into code and be played online.
